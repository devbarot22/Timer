Usage

Timer Persistence:

The timer is designed to continue running even if you refresh the page. It achieves this using the Web Storage API, which stores the start time of the timer. So, when you refresh the page, the timer will pick up from where it left off.

Note: The persistence might not work if you open the page in a private browsing mode or if your browser's settings prevent local storage.
